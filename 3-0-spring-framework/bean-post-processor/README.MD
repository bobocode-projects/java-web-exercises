Improve your *Spring* advanced skills üí™
### Task
Implement automatic String trimming functionality. So if I pass  "    Hello  "  as an argument to my bean‚Äôs method, or return it from the bean‚Äôs method, it gets automatically trimmed to "Hello".

- create annotation @Trimmed that you can put on class

- create annotation @EnableStringTrimming that will enable automatic String trimming for all beans that are annotated with @Trimmed

- create TrimmedAnnotationBeanPostProcessor that will check for beans that are marked with @Trimmed,

- create a proxy of those classes, and override methods. Proxy methods should:

  - trim all String arguments

  - trim all String return values

- extract  TrimmedAnnotationBeanPostProcessor  into a separate StringTrimmingConfiguration that is imported by @EnableStringTrimming

To verify your configuration, run `BeanPostProcessorTest.java`
